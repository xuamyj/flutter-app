First thought: Let's map out everything we need for the backend. [step1.jpg]

Then: Hmm... I definitely don't want to implement messaging from scratch... I'm sure there is some library that I can use.
Looking into:
  - Messaging in node.js + express
  - Messaging in React Native

Found: Oh nice, this [https://blog.expo.io/how-to-build-a-chat-app-with-react-native-3ef8604ebb3c] uses React Native + Firebase + Expo + Gifted Chat. Seems reasonable enough.

Chat Tutorial: Setting up a Server
  - Selected Email/password instead of Anonymous. Later we can add Facebook

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code!
  - Setting up a React Native app instead of using the starter snack

CS47 setup instructions [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCndhmmtONNlmeYlEKxELrf8Uzp_SzRCZudcpnw9wmM/edit]:
  - Part 1
  - 1. Already had homebrew
  - 2. Deleted old node and installed new node
  - 3. Ran command

  - Part 2
  - 1. Installing older version of simulator because upgrading OSX mid-quarter = very bad idea.
  - 2. Ran commands, called the app FlutterApp
  - 3. Ran commands, had to do
        sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
        but otherwise worked

Separately: Added a .gitignore to the main flutter-app folder for *.DS_Store (separate from the one inside FlutterApp which is created by React Native init command)

About to go back to the Chat Tutorial, but going to commit first.

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Looking at the provided snack.expo.io
  - They seem to have a components/ folder with Chat.js and Main.js files so let me copy that over
  - And a Fire.js file. Let me copy that over also
  - Their packages.json has:
        "react-native-elements": "0.18.5"
    so going to npm that in by running:
        npm i react-native-elements
    Whoops ours is "^0.19.1" and I have no idea if that's okay so gonna uninstall and reinstall:
        npm uninstall react-native-elements
        npm i react-native-elements@0.18.5
  - Not changing App.js just yet

Ah: After doing npm install/uninstall, seems like we need to Ctrl-C out of the `expo start` terminal and rerun `expo start`. Good to know

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code! -> App.js
  - Copied code into App.js
  - Error: Unable to resolve "react-navigation" from "App.js". Okay, time to npm again:
        npm install --save react-navigation
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - It seems like version react-navigation 3.0 is annoying, so going to download an older version to match their demo [https://snack.expo.io/@bacon/firebase-basic-chat]:
        npm uninstall react-navigation
        npm install --save react-navigation@2.3.1
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - Ok it's blank and no errors, so that's good, I think [screenshot1.png]

Side note: There is a veryyy cute cat curled up on a towel on the couch next to me. Zzzzzzzzzz...

Feels like a good time to commit.

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code! -> Main.js
  - Just followed it as is. It's a solid tutorial so far; everything is very nice and well-documented.

Side note update: "Yawwwwwwn," said the cat.

Side note update update: Now the cat is washing itself. Toooo cute.

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Chat Screen
  - Followed instructions
  - Need to add react-native-gifted-chat. The Chat Tutorial demo says
        "react-native-gifted-chat": "0.3.0"
  and the documentation [https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat] for react-native-gifted-chat says:
        Use version 0.2.x for RN >= 0.44.0
        Use version 0.1.x for RN >= 0.40.0
        Use version 0.0.10 for RN < 0.40.0
  - We're using
        "react-native": "https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-31.0.0.tar.gz"
    which according to this post [https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v31-0-0-is-now-available-cad6d0463f49] is based on RN 0.57
  - So I'm just going to run npm install without a version and see what happens:
        npm install react-native-gifted-chat --save
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - Ok it lets you type messages but they don't get saved, which I think is right? Also no errors so...

Committing again!

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Database
  - Copied things over up to the "Here is an example of the creds" picture.
  - Ah here is why we need Anonymous auth. Adding it back in; will figure out how to take it out later.
  - Continued following the tutorial. Ahhh so this is how Firebase works.

Chat Tutorial: Database -> components/Chat.js
  - Before I copy over any of this code, it seems to be missing a line of edits:
        import Fire from '../Fire';
  - Aha. Adding that line means we need to npm firebase in:
        npm install --save firebase
  - It is slowly installing...
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - Nice, maybe I should stop being surprised when npm works haha...

Back to Chat Tutorial: Database -> components/Chat.js
  - Copied things over
  - Getting errors:
        @firebase/database:, FIREBASE WARNING: set at /messages/-LR_hWPm1bDFOEunEJ6b failed: permission_denied
    and
        [Unhandled promise rejection: Error: PERMISSION_DENIED: Permission denied]
  - Ah okay so it turns out in Firebase, (left sidebar) Develop -> (left sidebar) Database -> (middle tab) Rules currently says:
        "rules": {
          ".read": false,
          ".write": false
        }
  Changing it to
        "rules": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          ".write": "auth != null"
        }
  as per Stack Overflow [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37403747/firebase-permission-denied]

Nice!! It works. Time to commit!

--------------------------------

Okay: What to do next? Let's see if we can get the bottom bar working. [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/tab-based-navigation.html]

1. Refactored Main to be ChatMain

2. Moved around functions and added comments in Fire.js, but code is the same

Works, committing again.

--------------------------------

Back to bottom bar:

3. Created placeholder HomeMain, GroupsMain, PostMain, and ProfileMain components.

4. Updated App.js so that each bottom tab is a StackNavigator

5. Ironically had to update react-navigation to 3.0.0:
        npm uninstall react-navigation
        npm install react-navigation

Now reading Firebase docs... Structure Your Database [https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data] is pretty useful

Ok committing.
