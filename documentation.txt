First thought: Let's map out everything we need for the backend. [step1.jpg]

Then: Hmm... I definitely don't want to implement messaging from scratch... I'm sure there is some library that I can use.
Looking into:
  - Messaging in node.js + express
  - Messaging in React Native

Found: Oh nice, this [https://blog.expo.io/how-to-build-a-chat-app-with-react-native-3ef8604ebb3c] uses React Native + Firebase + Expo + Gifted Chat. Seems reasonable enough.

Chat Tutorial: Setting up a Server
  - Selected Email/password instead of Anonymous. Later we can add Facebook

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code!
  - Setting up a React Native app instead of using the starter snack

CS47 setup instructions [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCndhmmtONNlmeYlEKxELrf8Uzp_SzRCZudcpnw9wmM/edit]:
  - Part 1
  - 1. Already had homebrew
  - 2. Deleted old node and installed new node
  - 3. Ran command

  - Part 2
  - 1. Installing older version of simulator because upgrading OSX mid-quarter = very bad idea.
  - 2. Ran commands, called the app FlutterApp
  - 3. Ran commands, had to do
        sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
        but otherwise worked

Separately: Added a .gitignore to the main flutter-app folder for *.DS_Store (separate from the one inside FlutterApp which is created by React Native init command)

About to go back to the Chat Tutorial, but going to commit first.

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Looking at the provided snack.expo.io
  - They seem to have a components/ folder with Chat.js and Main.js files so let me copy that over
  - And a Fire.js file. Let me copy that over also
  - Their packages.json has:
        "react-native-elements": "0.18.5"
    so going to npm that in by running:
        npm i react-native-elements
    Whoops ours is "^0.19.1" and I have no idea if that's okay so gonna uninstall and reinstall:
        npm uninstall react-native-elements
        npm i react-native-elements@0.18.5
  - Not changing App.js just yet

Ah: After doing npm install/uninstall, seems like we need to Ctrl-C out of the `expo start` terminal and rerun `expo start`. Good to know

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code! -> App.js
  - Copied code into App.js
  - Error: Unable to resolve "react-navigation" from "App.js". Okay, time to npm again:
        npm install --save react-navigation
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - It seems like version react-navigation 3.0 is annoying, so going to download an older version to match their demo [https://snack.expo.io/@bacon/firebase-basic-chat]:
        npm uninstall react-navigation
        npm install --save react-navigation@2.3.1
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - Ok it's blank and no errors, so that's good, I think [screenshot1.png]

Side note: There is a veryyy cute cat curled up on a towel on the couch next to me. Zzzzzzzzzz...

Feels like a good time to commit.

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code! -> Main.js
  - Just followed it as is. It's a solid tutorial so far; everything is very nice and well-documented.

Side note update: "Yawwwwwwn," said the cat.

Side note update update: Now the cat is washing itself. Toooo cute.

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Chat Screen
  - Followed instructions
  - Need to add react-native-gifted-chat. The Chat Tutorial demo says
        "react-native-gifted-chat": "0.3.0"
  and the documentation [https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat] for react-native-gifted-chat says:
        Use version 0.2.x for RN >= 0.44.0
        Use version 0.1.x for RN >= 0.40.0
        Use version 0.0.10 for RN < 0.40.0
  - We're using
        "react-native": "https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-31.0.0.tar.gz"
    which according to this post [https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v31-0-0-is-now-available-cad6d0463f49] is based on RN 0.57
  - So I'm just going to run npm install without a version and see what happens:
        npm install react-native-gifted-chat --save
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - Ok it lets you type messages but they don't get saved, which I think is right? Also no errors so...

Committing again!

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Database
  - Copied things over up to the "Here is an example of the creds" picture.
  - Ah here is why we need Anonymous auth. Adding it back in; will figure out how to take it out later.
  - Continued following the tutorial. Ahhh so this is how Firebase works.

Chat Tutorial: Database -> components/Chat.js
  - Before I copy over any of this code, it seems to be missing a line of edits:
        import Fire from '../Fire';
  - Aha. Adding that line means we need to npm firebase in:
        npm install --save firebase
  - It is slowly installing...
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - Nice, maybe I should stop being surprised when npm works haha...

Back to Chat Tutorial: Database -> components/Chat.js
  - Copied things over
  - Getting errors:
        @firebase/database:, FIREBASE WARNING: set at /messages/-LR_hWPm1bDFOEunEJ6b failed: permission_denied
    and
        [Unhandled promise rejection: Error: PERMISSION_DENIED: Permission denied]
  - Ah okay so it turns out in Firebase, (left sidebar) Develop -> (left sidebar) Database -> (middle tab) Rules currently says:
        "rules": {
          ".read": false,
          ".write": false
        }
  Changing it to
        "rules": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          ".write": "auth != null"
        }
  as per Stack Overflow [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37403747/firebase-permission-denied]

Nice!! It works. Time to commit!

--------------------------------

Okay: What to do next? Let's see if we can get the bottom bar working. [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/tab-based-navigation.html]

1. Refactored Main to be ChatMain

2. Moved around functions and added comments in Fire.js, but code is the same

Works, committing again.

--------------------------------

Back to bottom bar:

3. Created placeholder HomeMain, GroupsMain, PostMain, and ProfileMain components.

4. Updated App.js so that each bottom tab is a StackNavigator

5. Ironically had to update react-navigation to 3.0.0:
        npm uninstall react-navigation
        npm install react-navigation

Now reading Firebase docs... Structure Your Database [https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data] is pretty useful

Ok committing.

--------------------------------

Actually, let's do login first. Following this tutorial [https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-firebase-authentication-7652e1d2c8a2] for now.

Auth Tutorial: Creating our Screens
  - First made a folder inside components/ called authentication/ for these extra screens
  - Loading.js: copied directly from the tutorial
  - SignUp.js: copied directly from the tutorial
  - Login.js: copied directly from the tutorial
  - Did not copy Main.js from the tutorial since we already have our main app

Auth Tutorial: Creating our Screens -> App.js
  - Instead of copying App.js from the tutorial, looked at the react-naviation docs [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/auth-flow.html]
  - Now we are at "you should see our Loading screen with the ActivityIndicator spinning forever" -- nice.

Auth Tutorial: Determining if a user is authenticated
  - Copied it over except instead of
        import firebase from 'react-native-firebase'
    used
        import firebase from 'firebase';
  - Nice, we're already signed in from before, so it reroutes us to the main app, and everything there works as expected

Pausing the tutorial for a sec to add a Logout button to the Profile page for testing. Eventually this should be moved to a Settings page that gets accessed from the Profile page.
  - Actually, this is a good place to commit and go to sleep (y)

--------------------------------

Nov 18

Adding Logout button to Profile page
  - Okay, done
  - Also chnaged AuthLoading.js to go to Login instead of SignUp if the user is not logged in

Auth Tutorial: Signing a user up
  - Copied it over, but with
        import firebase from 'firebase';

Auth Tutorial: Logging an already existing user in
  - Copied it over, but with
        import firebase from 'firebase';
  - Fixed typo: pasword should be password

Nice, it works! Feels a bit slow but we can worry about that later. Committing!

--------------------------------

Now on Firebase Console [https://console.firebase.google.com]:

  1. Develop -> Authentication -> Sign-in method: disabled Anonymous sign-in

  2. Develop -> Authentication -> Users: deleted a bunch of test users

  3. Develop -> Database -> Data: deleted a bunch of messages

Now testing the app again:
  - Nice, it works.
  - The chat definitely needs to be updated later but it's fine for now.

(Nothing to commit yet because we only changed the db content and tested the app.)

Okay I think the plan now is going to be:
  I. User additional data (SignUp and Profile -> Settings)
  II. Create and view groups (Groups and Groups -> Create Group)
  III. Post items
  IV. View posted items (Home, Groups, and Profile -> Posted)
  V. More stuff after (fix Chat, mark items as read, etc) that but it's enough to think about for now

Going to use react-native-tab-view [https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view]:
        npm install react-native-tab-view

Added tabs and a Settings button to Settings page. Nothing displayed yet. Committing

--------------------------------

Commit: no change in functionality, just moved things around in the code to have consistent style (use StyleSheet and do `export default` at the end of the file)

--------------------------------

Wrote a bunch of code in Fire.js and connected it with Settings.js.

It was a decent amount of fiddling so committing again.

--------------------------------

Now that I know how to connect the Firebase stuff with the frontend stuff, going to work on layout for a bit. So everything should be in the components/ folder.

Okay, a bunch of layout was added (ofc, is very ugly and doesn't actually work).

Committing, and then will work on actual functionality :)

Afternoon update: Amending commit with better organized code

--------------------------------

Added subcomponents: Stories and Treasures (!)
Wrote a lot of test data. Thus far, everything is still hardcoded. There are no props being passed at any point of this app, lol.
Put them in HomeMain and Groups, but without filtering (ie. in Groups you still see all the items)

Yay! It is starting to take shape :D

--------------------------------

Okay, time to categorize some things.
Everything non-layout that needs to be done at this point:

Basic functionality
- Use camera to upload picture
- Connect things to backend
- Pass props so that the right stories/treasures/groups show up

Item lifecycle functionality
- Treasures should be modals
- Add button for starting a chat
- Figure out chat library + make chats between 2 people
- Add button for marking an item as given
- The entire flow for sending in your update

Cleanliness
- Error messages for forms
- Toasts for success messages for forms ()
- Autocomplete add to group ()
- Notif red circle for unfinished items

See README.md for things we're just not gonna think about for the time being
