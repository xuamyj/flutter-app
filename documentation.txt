First thought: Let's map out everything we need for the backend. [step1.png]

Then: Hmm... I definitely don't want to implement messaging from scratch... I'm sure there is some library that I can use.
Looking into:
  - Messaging in node.js + express
  - Messaging in React Native

Found: Oh nice, this [https://blog.expo.io/how-to-build-a-chat-app-with-react-native-3ef8604ebb3c] uses React Native + Firebase + Expo + Gifted Chat. Seems reasonable enough.

Chat Tutorial: Setting up a Server
  - Selected Email/password instead of Anonymous. Later we can add Facebook

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code!
  - Setting up a React Native app instead of using the starter snack

CS47 setup instructions [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCndhmmtONNlmeYlEKxELrf8Uzp_SzRCZudcpnw9wmM/edit]:
  - Part 1
  - 1. Already had homebrew
  - 2. Deleted old node and installed new node
  - 3. Ran command

  - Part 2
  - 1. Installing older version of simulator because upgrading OSX mid-quarter = very bad idea.
  - 2. Ran commands, called the app FlutterApp
  - 3. Ran commands, had to do
        sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
        but otherwise worked

Separately: Added a .gitignore to the main flutter-app folder for *.DS_Store (separate from the one inside FlutterApp which is created by React Native init command)

About to go back to the Chat Tutorial, but going to commit first.

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Looking at the provided snack.expo.io
  - They seem to have a components/ folder with Chat.js and Main.js files so let me copy that over
  - And a Fire.js file. Let me copy that over also
  - Their packages.json has:
        "react-native-elements": "0.18.5"
    so going to npm that in by running:
        npm i react-native-elements
    Whoops ours is "^0.19.1" and I have no idea if that's okay so gonna uninstall and reinstall:
        npm uninstall react-native-elements
        npm i react-native-elements@0.18.5
  - Not changing App.js just yet

Ah: After doing npm install/uninstall, seems like we need to Ctrl-C out of the `expo start` terminal and rerun `expo start`. Good to know

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code! -> App.js
  - Copied code into App.js
  - Error: Unable to resolve "react-navigation" from "App.js". Okay, time to npm again:
        npm install --save react-navigation
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - It seems like version react-navigation 3.0 is annoying, so going to download an older version to match their demo [https://snack.expo.io/@bacon/firebase-basic-chat]:
        npm uninstall react-navigation
        npm install --save react-navigation@2.3.1
  - Rerunning `expo start`
  - Ok it's blank and no errors, so that's good, I think [screenshot1.png]

Side note: There is a veryyy cute cat curled up on a towel on the couch next to me. Zzzzzzzzzz...

Feels like a good time to commit.

--------------------------------

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code! -> Main.js
  - Just followed it as is. It's a solid tutorial so far; everything is very nice and well-documented.

Side note update: "Yawwwwwwn," said the cat.

Side note update update: Now the cat is washing itself. Toooo cute.
