First thought: Let's map out everything we need for the backend. [step1.png]

Then: Hmm... I definitely don't want to implement messaging from scratch... I'm sure there is some library that I can use.
Looking into:
  - Messaging in node.js + express
  - Messaging in React Native

Found: Oh nice, this [https://blog.expo.io/how-to-build-a-chat-app-with-react-native-3ef8604ebb3c] uses React Native + Firebase + Expo + Gifted Chat. Seems reasonable enough.

Chat Tutorial: Setting up a Server
  - Selected Email/password instead of Anonymous. Later we can add Facebook

Chat Tutorial: Time to Code!
  - Setting up a React Native app instead of using the starter snack

CS47 setup instructions [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCndhmmtONNlmeYlEKxELrf8Uzp_SzRCZudcpnw9wmM/edit]:
  - Part 1
  - 1. Already had homebrew
  - 2. Deleted old node and installed new node
  - 3. Ran command

  - Part 2
  - 1. Installing older version of simulator because upgrading OSX mid-quarter = very bad idea.
  - 2. Ran commands, called the app FlutterApp
  - 3. Ran commands, had to do
        sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
        but otherwise worked

Separately: Added a .gitignore to the main flutter-app folder for *.DS_Store (separate from the one inside FlutterApp which is created by React Native init command)

About to go back to the Chat Tutorial, but going to commit first.
